5: b'THE \xc3\x9cBER-DIFFERENTIAL Arthur Masuaku \xc2\xa34.4m 0.4% TSB ARS (H) King Arthur is undoubtedly the best LB since Roberto Carlos so he\xe2\x80\x99s a steal at \xc2\xa34.4m. Has been playing OOP at LW under Moyes. Don\xe2\x80\x99t expect a cleanie vs ARS but fancy him to get an assist or 2 # FPL # GW17 pic.twitter.com/aB5J9ozwX7'
6: b'THE CLEANIE Chris Smalling \xc2\xa35.4m 4% TSB BOU (H) United have kept 9 clean sheets this season, 4 of which Smalling has played a part in. They\xe2\x80\x99ve also conceded just 3 league goals at Old Trafford. You can count on them adding to that as they host Bournemouth # FPL # GW17 pic.twitter.com/u8myoDl6I6'
7: b'THE BALLSY Alexis Sanchez \xc2\xa311.8m 2.8% TSB whu (a) Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been on top form this season, probably cos he\xe2\x80\x99s itching for a move away. A hattie in his last trip to the London Stadium makes him an appealing pick. Pricey, but also a differential picked by 2.8% # FPL # GW17 pic.twitter.com/H08yrcOMED'

9: b'THE ESSENTIAL Mo Salah \xc2\xa39.9m 55.7% TSB WBA (H) If you haven\xe2\x80\x99t got this guy yet, what have you been doing? Signing of the season by far. He\xe2\x80\x99s the top FPL points scorer and only member of the club. Should add to his tally with a tasty home fixture v WBA # FPL # GW17 pic.twitter.com/Gc6me0YaMi'
