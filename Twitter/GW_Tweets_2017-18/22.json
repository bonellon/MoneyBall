3: b"It says a lot about the last 6 gameweeks when you make these transfers, and the player you'll miss the most is a budget midfielder from Crystal Palace # FPL # GW22 # premiumtrollspic.twitter.com/0Ch9v23MGM"
4: b'If Salah is out for only one game ( # GW22) then no point in selling if you want him back again when fit, especially if you bought him early and cheap. Leave on bench for a gw or two! Also makes the Free hit chip a viable option for # DGW22 # fpl'
5: b'Not getting Kane for the DGW. # GW22 # FPL # kanexit'
6: b'# GW22 # DGW22 # FPL Kane odds to - 2.5(Swa) 2.75(Whu) Sonny odds to - 8.5(Swa) 7.5(Whu) Eriksen odds to - 25(Swa) 22(Whu) Arnautovic odds to - 12(Wba) 19(Tot) Hazard odds to - 9.0 Sterling odds to - 6.0'

8: b'Only really debating minor changes. Might risk Elliot even though Pope is in good form. One of Gomez/Robertson will get benched, so Calvert-Lewin (who I think will be rotated for Niasse) will add another point to his tally. # FPL # GW22 https://twitter.com/HypeTrainRob/status/947597253069492233 \xe2\x80\xa6'
9: b'Managed 50pts for # FPL # GW21 and have made 3 transfers (-4) ahead of # GW22. Gone for Kane as captain despite having a pesky cold. Eriksen and Verty come in for flailing Chelsea assets. Arnautovic comes in for Choupo-Moting who has caused headaches. P.s. Happy New Year everyone. pic.twitter.com/GR8FXgExgK'
