537: b'Avoiding hits in the last few GWs has helped me immensely! This week, it will help even more, because people are using up their FTs and there are Carabao Cup & FA Cup matches + transfer window is open. There will be a lot of points hits for # GW25. Play smart. Hold FTs. # FPL'
538: b'Would you sell Harry Kane these incoming fixtures? # FPL # gw25'

540: b'Maybe gambling on Danilo playing # gw25! Guardiola seemed unhappy with Zinchenko out of position when @ NUFC scored. Arnautovic for Son. Free up 1,1 million for # gw26. But you need to wait for eventual injuries/rotation in the @ Carabao_Cup and # FACup! # Follow me for more # fpl # tips'
