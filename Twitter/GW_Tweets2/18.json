113: b"This was my thread on the safe, differential and uber differential \xc2\xa9 options for # GW18 Hope this helps you in making the right choices. Remember to have a strong VC as rotation may hit hard! Like's and RT's appreciated! # FPL # FantasyPL"
114: b'Uber Differential \xc2\xa9 Options Lacazette Burnley (H) Last () matches: Goals 1 Assists 2 Points: Can be a great alternative to Auba, looking sharp in his sub appearances. His minutes have been a problem since his injury. # FantasyPL # FPL # GW18'
115: b'Pellegrini\'s exact words on Lucas Perez suggest the striker still faces a late fitness test: "Lucas Perez, we will see him tomorrrow [if] he\'s able now to be in the squad list". # FFScout # FPL # GW18 # whufc'
116: b'Uber Differential \xc2\xa9 Options Ings Huddersfield (A) Last () matches: Goals 2 Assists 0 Points: Coming back from injury but was in decent form before that. Scored a brace on comeback. Huddersfield defense looking better lately. # FPL # GW18'
117: b"Uber Differential \xc2\xa9 Options Rashford Cardiff (A) Last matches: Goals 1 Assists 4 Points: In good form and getting minutes in the absence of Martial, Sanchez. Playing upfront. Don't know what/ how new manager will line up. # FantasyPL # FPL # GW18"
118: b'Differential \xc2\xa9 Options Hazard Leicester City (H) Last matches: Goals 1 Assists 5 Points: Heavily involved in all Chelsea offense and picking up form after returning from injury. Leicester defense can be frustrating. # FantasyPL # FPL # GW18'
119: b'Differential \xc2\xa9 Options Salah Wolves (A) Last matches: Goals 4 Assists 1 Points: On a high after his hat trick a week ago. Wolves defense susceptible. Wolves at home very compact against other Top 6 teams this season. # FantasyPL # FPL # GW18'
120: b'Deferential \xc2\xa9 Options Kane Everton (A) Last matches: Goals 3 Assists 2 Points: Good record against Everton. Decent form. Played only few minutes midweek. Can be inconsistent. Was ill although played midweek. # FPL # GW18 # FantasyPL # FPLCommunity'
121: b'Safe \xc2\xa9 Options Sterling Cristal Palace (H) Last matches: Goals 3 Assists 4 Points: Playing at home and scoring for fun. Played only a few minutes midweek & last weekend. Like Sane, very little could go wrong # FPL # GW18 # FantasyPL # FPLCommunity'
122: b'Safe \xc2\xa9 Options Aubameyang Burnley (H) Last matches: Goals 3 Assists 2 Points: Burnley defense generally in shambles this season, Auba in good form. Burnley looked good last game. Auba off last 2 games. Played midweek. # FPL # GW18 # FantasyPL'
123: b'Safe \xc2\xa9 Options Sane Crystal Palace (H) Last matches: Goals 3 Assists 2 Points: In cracking form and playing at home. Rested midweek. Not much can go wrong with him this weekend. # FPL # GW18 # FantasyPL # FPLCommunity'
