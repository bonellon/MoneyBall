233: b'# GW16 # FPL Summary: 61pts. Unexpectedly a green arrow without Salah. Grateful for that. Doc, Robo & Alonso delivers again! Anderson hit paid back in the 2nd week! Thankful for Auba return. Kane rested, Wilson injured 222k OR now. Bring on # GW17! pic.twitter.com/34kGZQ9wBA'

Second team had Salah captain scored 120pts and jumped to 230th. 30 transfers remaining.pic.twitter.com/DrRVeBai4i'
235: b"As I love me a poll, I thought I'd once again seek the advice of the amazing # FPL # FPLCommunity ahead of # GW17. I've no Kane or Sterling. So it's hold Hazard / Wilson and.... Thank you all"
236: b"Manchester Utd Key Forwards Rashford has gotten game time as Sanchez has gone missing and he's hit the straps lately. Can be a great enabler. Lukaku is a world class scorer but his current form is shit. With easy fixtures, he may turn a corner. # FPL # GW17 pic.twitter.com/ggAjAxm5Iq"
237: b"Manchester Utd Key Midfielders Martial is their only midfielder who's actually in any sort of form but he's now injured. Could be a decent prospect if fit. Lingard, if he can nail a place can be the one to watch out for. # FPL # GW17 # FantasyPL # FPLCommunitypic.twitter.com/v7jCZt2Q8Z"
238: b"Manchester United In the next 5 fixtures, they face only 1 of the Big 6. Key Defenders For a defense which has kept just 2 CS from their first 16 games, it's best to avoid them even with easy fixtures. Dalot looked bright last game. # FPL # GW17 # FantasyPLpic.twitter.com/wRfjCK44X2"
239: b'Arsenal Key Forwards Auba is the highest scoring forward & seems to be a favourite for most managers at the moment. Lacazette is the one to go to if you cannot afford Auba. Burnley game a red herring coming 2 days after Spurs game. # FPL # GW17 # FantasyPLpic.twitter.com/4QnCnpMCrN'
240: b'Arsenal Key Midfielders Ramsey, Ozil would both be super options of they could keep themselves fit. Torreira seems to a plucky little player, so good on the ball and is now in the goals too. Cheap as dirt. # FPL # GW17 # FantasyPL # FPLCommunitypic.twitter.com/Wia96gmg6p'
241: b'Arsenal In the next 5 fixtures, they face 1 of the Big 6. Key Defenders Kolasinac looks to be their best bet getting plenty of assist opportunities. Rotation fear. Would take only a staunch gunner to double up on their defense. # FPL # GW17 # FantasyPLpic.twitter.com/PjunivtnJ9'
242: b'Spurs Key Midfielders/ Forwards Plenty of options here to suit your taste/ budget. Eriksen is always right up there for goals/ assists for Spurs. On most free kicks/ corners. Son in red hot form. Relatively cheap. Minutes an issue. # FPL # GW17 # FantasyPLpic.twitter.com/IH5wmVgglC'
243: b'Spurs In the next 5 fixtures, they face none of the Big 6. Key Defenders Lloris is the best way into what could be a very profitable Spurs defense run. Trippier, when back, should score plenty with those fixtures on the horizon. # FPL # GW17 # FantasyPLpic.twitter.com/0N63tuJsfp'
244: b'Chelsea Key Forwards Morata and Giroud both should see plenty of game time in this packed schedule which lies ahead. Morata gets plenty of chances but is so wasteful in front of the goal. Giroud is more used as an impact sub. # FPL # GW17 # FantasyPLpic.twitter.com/9t87YmnliH'
245: b'Chelsea Key Midfielders Hazard looks to be getting better after his injury hiccups and is primed to start most games. Willian & Pedro should also get points but rotation might be a big issue. Kante can be a decent 5th midfielder. # FPL # GW17 # FantasyPLpic.twitter.com/RyUYTEUBc0'
246: b'Chelsea In the next 5 fixtures, they face none of the Big 6. Key Defenders Alonso should rake up plenty of points with those fixtures. Luiz and Kepa are very good options if you wish to double up on Chelsea defense. # FPL # GW17 # FantasyPL # FPLCommunitypic.twitter.com/6yEqw5b7zk'
247: b'Quick captain poll for # gw17 # fpl'
248: b"Liverpool Key Forwards Firmino the only reasonable option in this category. Although he does play deep most of the time and frankly there are better options available considering his price and Liverpool's fixtures. # FPL # GW17 # FantasyPL # FPLCommunitypic.twitter.com/NUujDVMjID"
249: b"Liverpool In the next 5 fixtures, they face 3 of the Big 6. Key Defenders Allison & Robertson are on fire. If you don't own a pool defender, then this isn't the time to get one in. TAA seemed to pick a knock in the CL game. # FPL # GW17 # FantasyPLpic.twitter.com/6rvyUYuodA"
250: b"Manchester City Key Forwards Apparently Ag\xc3\xbcero is back in training and he should offer great value once he's fit. Jesus will get minutes in the congested fixtures & could be a great punt if he can find his shooting boots. # FPL # GW17 # FantasyPL # FPLCommunitypic.twitter.com/mRWquVIwyJ"
251: b'Manchester City Key Midfielders Sterling & Sane best options depending on your budget. Should play most minutes. Bernardo can be a decent punt now that David Silva & Fernandinho are injured. KDB should be back shortly. # FPL # GW17 # FantasyPL # FPLCommunitypic.twitter.com/cJRbe2DPwY'
252: b'Manchester City In the next 5 fixtures, they face only 1 of the Big 6. Key Defenders Laporte & Ederson the best way into their defense. Minimal rotation risk. Steer clear of the rest for fear of rotation. # FPL # GW17 # FantasyPL # FPLCommunitypic.twitter.com/Hok8RgIEpg'

290: b'Who is your Captain for # GW17 ? # FPL'
291: b'# BARTOT Thoughts \xe2\x80\xa2 Spurs looked good on the attack. \xe2\x80\xa2 Son looked as advanced as Kane as did Moura when he came on. \xe2\x80\xa2 Kane looked good though and had a beautiful ball to Danny Rose near the end. Also assisted Moura. \xe2\x80\xa2 Walker-Pieters seems a no go. # FPL # GW17'
292: b'# LIVNAP Thoughts \xe2\x80\xa2 Salah continues to look good and should have scored more. \xe2\x80\xa2 Mane misses some absolute sitters. \xe2\x80\xa2 Alisson saves Liverpool and their failure to put away chances with a great save late on \xe2\x80\xa2 Rotation worries will continue in Feb. # FPL # GW17'
