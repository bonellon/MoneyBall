10: b'This would my Free Hit team if I had to select one Schmeichel Robbo Azpilicueta Digne Mane Hazard Siguardsson Salah Fraser Wilson Vardy Hamer Bednarek Calvert-Lewin Connolly Salah to Tielemans & Calvert-lewin to Lacazette (if you prefer 3-4-3 formation) # FPL # GW33 # BGW33'
11: b'Differentials 1. Calvert-Lewin 2. Tielemans 3. Siguardsson # FPL # GW33 # BGW33'
12: b'Captains Here are my top 3 choices 1. Hazard 2. Mane 3. Vardy Hazard edges it due to West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s inability to defend Captain Punt Wilson Bournemouth will look to get into winning ways against Burnley who have kept only 1 clean sheet in 9 games # FPL # GW33 # BGW33'
13: b"Chelsea v West Ham I would only consider Hazard & Azpilicueta from Chelsea. Sarri has been rotating his cb's in the last 2 games, so it might be Luiz's turn on the bench If only Hudson-Odoi or Loftus-Cheek were assured starters, their price and quality do standout # FPL # GW33"
14: b'Everton should make it difficult for Arsenal and probably play physical game, so Siguardsson or their defence could be their key performers in this fixture. # FPL # GW33 # BGW33'
15: b'Everton v Arsenal Everton have been resurgent in recent weeks with 4 clean sheets in 5 games play an inform Arsenal side battling for a top 4 finish. Only Lacazette and may be Kolasinac are the Arsenal player\xe2\x80\x99s that provide any appeal at this time. # FPL # GW33 # BGW33'
16: b'We can\xe2\x80\x99t look beyond Rondon as possible a Newcastle target, he has been amongst the goals and assists in recent games. Perez might be another to consider # FPL # GW33 # BGW33'
17: b'Newcastle v Crystal Palace Zaha is in great form continues, with attacking returns in 5 out of his last 8 games, whilst Milivojevic continues his great output from the penalty spot. Patrick Van Aanholt always seems to have strong end of season, so watch out for him # FPL # GW33'
18: b'Huddersfield V Leicester Tielemans has looked really classy since joining the foxes with 5 attacking return in the last 5 games, Vardy is the obvious target from this game Leicester have only had 1 back to back clean sheets this season, can they make that 2? # FPL # GW33 # BGW33'
19: b'Bournemouth v Burnley Plenty of assets in this fixture to choose from; GW31 star man Josh King, Wilson, Fraser & Brooks from Bournemouth. Whilst Burnley have Barnes, Wood & McNeil to pick from # FPL # GW33 # BGW33'
20: b'Those that no longer WC/FH left might want to get a saints asset in preparation for DGW35, Ward-Prowse, Redmond, Valery & Gunn stand out due to their budget enabling price. # FPL # GW33 # BGW33'
21: b'Southampton V Liverpool Liverpool go into this game without a clean sheet in 3 games, their tight defence is starting to concede Mane is still the inform player whilst Salah goals have dried up with only 1 goal in 9 games. Robbo looked back to his best against Spurs # FPL # GW33'
