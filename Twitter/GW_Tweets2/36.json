9: b"If chasing try something different, a captains punt on Firmino, TAA or Robbo or even a Man City could yield some returns. Enjoy the weekend's action everyone # FPL # GW36"
10: b"Mini League Depending on if you are chasing or leading, now is the time to start looking at differentials. Triple Captain is a differential, don't do anything else. If leading make sure you try to captain the player you think your rival would captain or TC # FPL # GW36"
11: b"Quick advice Before making transfers, make sure you take into account GW37 + GW38. Don't waste FT's, they are previous and any hits need to thought through so that they result in gains # FPL # GW36"
12: b'Captain Picks 1. Salah 2. Mane 3. Sterling Differential Captain Punt 1. Son 2. Vardy 3. TAA 4. Hazard Weekly Differential Punts 1. Babel 2. Sean Morrison 3. Ings # FPL # GW36'
13: b'United are in bad form face a Chelsea side who haven\xe2\x80\x99t won in the last 2 PL games but have been scoring apart from the Liverpool game. Chelsea generally don\xe2\x80\x99t do too well in away games to a top 6 rival. This game is too close to predict, will Hazard make an impact? # FPL # GW36'
14: b'The Battle for Top 4 places Spurs at home to West Ham sounds easy but I expect Spurs minds to be on the Champions League semi final which is one of the biggest games in their history. Remember Son is suspended for the 1st leg of CL, so he should start this game # FPL # GW36'
15: b'Would you make these transfers? # FPL # GW36 # FPLCommunitypic.twitter.com/fGMsdvCtNK'
16: b"Burnley's last 2 home games resulted in clean sheets but now they play a team on whole different level to Cardiff & Wolves. Prior to those 2 clean sheets there were none in 8 games. # FPL # GW36"
17: b'Burnley v Man City If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to TC a Liverpool attacker then Man City could be the answer as they play Burnley in GW36, Leicester at home in GW37 and Brighton GW38. Games in which you have to fancy the likes of Sterling to get attacking returns. # FPL # GW36'
18: b'If you can\xe2\x80\x99t have both Mane & Salah in your squads then consider a defensive double up as you have to fancy the league best defence to keep a clean sheet against a poor Huddersfield attack # FPL # GW36'
19: b'Liverpool v Huddersfield This could be the fixture a lot of mangers try to cash in on their Triple Captain chip as Salah or Mane play a team that has kept 1 clean sheet in 13 games conceding a whopping 32 goals over those games. # FPL # GW36'
20: b"I did 2 transfers, I choose Wilson over Perez as Deeney\xe2\x80\x99s replacement; well that went great didn't it. On the plus side I took a hit to replace Duffy with Jonny so gained 13 points. Here are some of my thoughts about GW36 # FPL # GW36"
