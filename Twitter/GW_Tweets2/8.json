112: b"Jokanovic confirms that Alfie Mawson will be part of the squad this weekend. Questions over Tom Cairney's fitness seem to concern his capacity to start - the Scottish midfielder was indeed a substitute for Fulham in their defeat to Everton last weekend. # FFScout # FPL # GW8"
113: b"# GW8 I'm more or less sorted. Just have one small decision to make. If you had to start one of these 4 players, who would it be? # FPL # FPLCommunity"
114: b'JV \xe2\x80\xa6 80/20, 90/10 likely to start # FPL # GW8 # Vardy'
115: b'(10) Players on my watch/consider list: BRI - Knockaert, Ryan HUD - no one LEI - have Maddison, maybe Pereira/Schmeichel, Vardy NEW - just Lascelles for now WAT - points too spread. Holebas after his next yellow WHU - Fab, Zab, Yarm, Arnie for sure WOL -Doherty/Patricio # fpl # gw8'
116: b'(9) so where does that leave me? typical Top6: LIV/CHE hold & ride. MCI is tough. Love sterling & aguero but rotation threat for $$$ ARS/MUN - skip TOT - mainly about cover this wknd Other teams with good fixtures: BRI, HUD, LEI, NEW, WAT, WHU, WOL # fpl # gw8'
117: b'(8) fixtures cont. TOT - CAR captaincy issue, IMO WHU & WOL away not easy, which 5/7 are tough. Definitely double to triple after GW15 but not before. Need to cover Kane this wknd WAT - 8/11 decent run WHU - 13/16 look good WOL - 7/10 look good # fpl # gw8'
118: b"(7) fixtures cont. MUN - never know who's gonna turn up. Shaw the only bright light right now :'-( NEW - 10 games no top 6, but again no one except maybe Lascelles SOU - Ings is cheap cover and 4/8 are OK. Willing to sell him and go without # fpl # gw8"
119: b'(6) fixtures cont. LEI - 7/8 are good. Maddison perfect cover. Maybe a D too though? LIV - great run upcoming. Need to keep Mane and think about Salah for future. Captain contenders for 9 and 10 MCI - hard to bet against but rough fixtures and rotation headaches # fpl # gw8'
120: b'(5) fixtures cont. EVE - purple patch is done. every other wk is tough. Willing to sell Walcott and miss Rich/Siggy FUL - similar to EVE. Mitrovic talisman is adequate cover and cheap so hold for now HUD - 12/15 are great but they suck so SKIP # fpl # gw8'
121: b'(4) fixtures cont... BUR is similar to BOU so avoiding for now CAR - not going near. rough then better for 5-6 CHE - next 14/18 good. Best players rested midweek. Haz + Alonso + maybe triple up? CRY - plays 4/6 against top 6. Keep ObiWan as bench fodder but avoid # fpl # gw8'
122: b"(3) I've had a look at fixtures for all teams for the next while... ARS - looks reasonable for 4/6 but then gets tough. Not interested BOU - getting ugly fast. Fraser adequate cover, sell SCook BRI - sexy fixtures with only 2 of next 14 vs. top 6. but who? # fpl # gw8"
123: b"(2) so first of all, the team. I'm ranked 178k with a value of 103.6. 1M ITB and 2 FT for this gw. Players on the [potential] sell list (in some order of priority): - Mendy - Walcott - Ings - SCook - Ederson - Mane # gw8 # fpl pic.twitter.com/rWLkGLziDV"
124: b'# gw8 # fpl thread (1) so after no transfers in 2 weeks, starting to finally wrap my head around team changes and my plans. Check out this thread for my thoughts on watchlist, team fixtures, team surgery etc. The big one is how to cover Spurs but some other gems in here too. enjoy!'
