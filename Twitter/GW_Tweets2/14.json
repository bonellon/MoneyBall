111: b'Uber Differential \xc2\xa9 Options Zaha Burnley (H) Last matches: Goals 0 Assists 1 Points: Burnley defense has been asleep this season shipping in 27 goals and keeping just 3 CS. Ripe for a haul. Shaky form might be an issue. # fantasypl # FPL # GW14'

113: b'Uber Differential \xc2\xa9 Options Jimenez Cardiff (A) Last matches: Goals 1 Assists 2 Points: Fulcrum of Wolves offense. Playing against a fellow newly promoted team a motivation. Wolves were off their game last GW against HUD. # FantasyPL # FPL # GW14'
114: b"Differential \xc2\xa9 Options Sterling Bournemouth (H) Last () matches: Goals 3 Assists 5 Points: Hot property of EPL right now, in the midst of a dream purple patch. Pep rotation fear as he's played a full CL game mid week. # FPL # GW14 # FantasyPL"
115: b'Differential \xc2\xa9 Options Martial Southampton (A) Last matches: Goals 5 Assists 0 Points: Southampton defense not the best and Martial in great form. Played midweek. Lukaku & Sanchez might eat into his minutes. # FPLCommunity # FPL # GW14'
116: b'Differential \xc2\xa9 Options Hazard Fulham (H) Last matches: Goals 0 Assists 1 Points: Playing Fulham who have been the whipping boys this year. Plagued by injuries and Fulham seemed reinvigorated under Ranieri. Form down. # FPLCommunity # FPL # GW14'
117: b"Safe \xc2\xa9 Options Ag\xc3\xbcero Bournemouth (H) Last matches: Goals 3 Assists 2 Points: Cracking home form and playing Bournemouth who've lost 3 on the bounce. Played midweek in the CL and remains a rotation threat. # FPLCommunity # FPL # GW14 # FantasyPL"
